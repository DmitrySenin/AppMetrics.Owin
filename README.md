# AppMetrics.Owin
Packages containing Owin Middleware, AspNet Web API and AspNet MVC extensions to [App Metrics](https://github.com/alhardy/AppMetrics).

The Owin Middleware provides the same web metrics recorded by [App.Metrics.Extensions.Middleware](https://www.nuget.org/packages/App.Metrics.Extensions.Middleware/) but are provided through Owin Middleware rather than AspNetCore Middleware.

All [App.Metrics](https://github.com/alhardy/AppMetrics) packages support .NET 4.5.2 except [App.Metrics.Extensions.Middleware](https://www.nuget.org/packages/App.Metrics.Extensions.Middleware/)
